                <h2>A background on Gandalf</h2>   
                <p>The Valar sent an order of the Istari to Middle Earth itself, 
                    they sent five wizards in order to oppose the Dark Lord Sauron, with Gandalf being one of those chosen.
                    Once he arrived on Middle Earth, he walked among the elves as a stranger as he learned their ways and taught them his.<br> 
                    After revealing himself as one of the Istari, he joined the White Council to investigate a dark power within Dol Guldur.
                    <br>Now Gandalf has become part of the Fellowship of the Ring on the quest to destroy the one ring to finally put a stop to
                    the evil of Sauron.
